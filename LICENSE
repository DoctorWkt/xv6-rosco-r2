This project is a conglomeration of code from
various places.

Most of the kernel code is `xv6` code and uses
the `xv6` license. There is some `rosco` code
in the kernel, too.

The libraries and include files are from FreeBSD
and are under a BSD license.

The userland programs mostly come from FreeBSD.
If an individual program doesn't have a specific
copyright/license at the top of the source files,
you can assume it's BSD licensed.
